export coord to file ... 



!!!!!!!!! NOTE !!!!!!!!!!!! 
after sample grid, each direction abs(pml) layers must 
multiply by sample factor

 ****old abs layers ****
old number of pml layers x1 is 20
old number of pml layers x2 is 20
old number of pml layers y1 is 20
old number of pml layers y2 is 20
old number of pml layers z1 is 20
old number of pml layers z2 is 0

 ****after sample new abs layers ****
new number of pml layers x1 is 40
new number of pml layers x2 is 40
new number of pml layers y1 is 40
